My favorite programing language is dart because it's what I'm using right now for work and it blends just the right amount of simplicity (e.g., it takes care of garbage collection automatically) and manual declarations (e.g., it requires you to specify types of variables unlike python) for an intuitive and easy to use coding expirience.
